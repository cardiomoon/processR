This is the update of the package 'processR'. I have fixed all existing problems at 
https://cran.rstudio.com//web/checks/check_results_processR.html.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
