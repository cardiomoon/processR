## CRAN submission comment by Swetlana Herbrandt

Thanks, please omit the redundant "R" in your title.

Please write package names, software names and API names in single quotes (e.g. 'SAS') in Title and Description.

Please do not comment out your examples and use \donttest{} instead:

\examples{
  examples for users and checks:
  executable in < 5 sec

  donttest{
      further examples for users (not used for checks)
  }
}


Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Swetlana Herbrandt

## Resubmission comment

I have omitted the redundant "R" in title.

I have written software names in single quotes (e.g. 'PROCESS','SAS','SPSS') in Title and Description.

I have used \donttest{} in my examples.

Thank you very much for your comment!
